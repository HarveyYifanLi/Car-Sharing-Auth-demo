## Functionalities and Tech Stack
* This is a full stack JavaScript Web SPA
* Frondend: React.js framework with Redux for state management
* Backend: Express.js framework in Node.js runtime engine
* Database: MongoDB non-relational database
* Security: User Authentication + Authorization using a combination of bcrypt.js and Json-Web-Token (JWT) 

## Extra notes
* As the app is using the Node.js runtime engine and MongoDB as the database, thus please install Node.js and MongoDB on your local machine in order to run the appllication.
* Once Node.js and MongoDB are installed and this repo has been cloned into a local directory, follow below instructions and run commands to start the database server first:
** cd into where the /bin dir of Mongodb is located so that you can start the mongodb server:
** e.g. 'cd /Users/yifan/mongodb/bin' then start the mongod DB server: 'mongod --dbpath=/Users/yifan/data/db/'
